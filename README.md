## Manage IoT device state anywhere using AWS IoT Greengrass and AWS IoT Device Shadow
This repo is the source code of AWS blog post **Manage IoT device state anywhere using AWS IoT Greengrass and AWS IoT Device Shadow** 

Internet of Things (IoT) developers often need to implement a robust mechanism for managing IoT device state either locally or remotely. A typical example is a smart home radiator, an IoT device where you can use the built-in control panel to adjust the temperature (device state), or trigger temperature adjustment messages remotely from a software application running in the cloud.  

By following the blog and the source code in this repository, you can build a Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT to simulate a smart home radiator, by using AWS IoT Device Shadow service and AWS IoT Greengrass.
